Google removed the ability to upload files. The latest versions will be found in this link. You get the legacy version from the Downloads page. Version numbers are weird and I'm also changing the name to GoTTS because of issues with Google search. Have fun and try the demo. :) If you can think of a funnier demo for these that is PG13, let me know.

# History #
Simple app, powerful tool. I wrote this tool as an undergraduate at the University of South Florida on my own back in 2010. This happens to be my favorite project despite it's simplicity. I'm finally graduating with my MS in Cp.E. (2014) and will be making an improved version to help me with studying for the three language classes I'm taking. It turns out that the pronounciation for most languages is spot on, while the translations are meh....

<h1>Description</h1>
JGoogle TTS is a text-to-speech (TTS) reader adapted from the server page code of translate.google.com. Googleâ€™s code was made for the purpose of pronouncing translated words. The goal of this is to have it read out words in as many languages possible and to have all text play smoothly. JGoogle TTS accepts unlimited characters. Currently, it buffers the whole script. Later, you can use the MP3 files to replay it in your preferred player.<br>
<br>
In the directory, there is JGoogleTTS and JGoogleTTS2. JGoogleTTS uses Netbeans Platform. JGoogleTTS2 uses just a JFrame. In the future, I'll try to add a single Jar file to be run and screen shots. Right now, it is simple, but it works well.<br>
<br>
THIS PROGRAM IS IN NO WAY A COPY, PORT, TRANSLATION, OR ANYTHING ELSE OF "Google TTS", which is a C++ program that is very similar. I created this project before I even knew it existed, but apparently after it was created.<br>
<br>
This project is open-source with GNU GPLv3. You are welcome to contribute.<br>
<br>
Here is the full list of available languages. Some of these are hoaxes. These were included so that if Google ever extends previous hoaxes (Hacker and Klingon), you will be able to choose these. For TTS, Google does not yet support all of these. What do they support? Try it for yourself. It may not make sense to have every language that Google recognizes, but 4 years later, it worked like I hoped. Google improved these services and added more languages, but this tool (code-wise) did not change. However, the quality improved greatly thanks to Google.<br>

<h1>News</h1>
<h2>January 26, 2014</h2>
New version! Four years later...Wow. I'm surprised that Google hasn't changed the protocols yet (this app still works!). I'm excited that I've had more than 1K downloads.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h1>Want to try it out?</h1>
Just download the zip file. Everything is there. Run the "runme" file and voila.<br>
<br>
<br>
<BR/><br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol><li>Download the all-in-one zip file from the Downloads tab above.<br>
</li><li>Using WinZip, 7z (my fav) or your favorite program, extract all files from the archive.<br>
</li><li>Assuming you got the first two steps correctly, just run it. The .jar file is an executable and a modern version of Java should allow it to run by double clicking. Alternatively, you can use the .sh (Mac OS, Linux, UNIX) or .bat (Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, 8.1)file to run it.<br>
</li><li>You can past plain text or open a text file. I don't recommend opening other file types.<br>
</li><li>You can retrieve the MP3 files in the temp directory. On my Windows 8 machine, they ended up with paths like this. C:\Users\myUserID\AppData\Local\Temp\jgoogle_tts-6472952126462532018.mp3</li></ol>

This is the command in the script files (.bat/.sh):<br>
java -jar "JGoogleTTS2.jar"<br>
<br>
Important: The easy way to run this jar file is to download the runme file from the Downloads section. Keep them in the same directory and just double-click the runme file.<br>
<br>
Note: some browsers like Chrome may move or rename the script file when you download it. It is perfectly safe. It's just a txt file (script) that runs the command above.<br>
<br>
<h1>Tips</h1>
<h3>Remember that this requires fast internet to download the audio files.</h3>
<h3>If there is a horribly long delay, you have way too much text.</h3>
<h3>If you have no playback, you may have selected a language that Google has no translation for.</h3>
<h3>If you cannot run it at all, you should download Java.</h3>
<h3>Read the README file</h3>
<h3>If you are writing code, give credit to the author and reference this website. Thanks. :)</h3>
